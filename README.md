# Cplusplus-Program

I interpret user needs and implement them into a program with system analysis.This refers to receiving appropriate feedback from users, and using that information to implement changes or modifications to the coding. 
Using user story helps with this, because it is a tool commonly used in Agile development. It assists with gathering and understanding information needed from the end-user. Once information is gathered, it will then create a description for it.
There are multiple ways to develop programs. For example, using different project management strategies, like Waterfall methodology, can help. By implementing the needs and gathering the specific strategies, it can aid in developing programs.
The agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is Scrum. This process gives me the opportunity to plan, test, and integrate in specific ways that I would've never thought of.
Being a good team member in software development means following the rules and completing the tasks at hand in a timely manner. This means following team protocol, whether that be in coding style or design techniques. Being courteous and vocal will aid in completing projects in a timely manner.
